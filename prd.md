## 1) Purpose & Outcomes

Build a high-performing, **luxury, high-taste, local-flavor** static HTML website for **[CommunityName]** that positions permanent manufactured/mobile home living as the **future of single-family**—simple, elegant, and **more affordable** than comparable apartments.

**Primary outcomes**

- **Convert**: Clear CTAs (Apply, Contact, Resident Login) and a **pain-based hero hook** highlighting local **3 bed / 2 bath apartment** costs vs. owning.
- **Inform**: Accurate, benefit-led content: pricing (**[LotRent]**), **PetScreening.com** policy, **[Amenities]**, **[LocationHighlights]**.
- **Support**: Resident access via **[PortalURL]** (DoorLoop expected).

**Non-negotiables**

- **No emojis**. Use **SVG line icons** only.
- **No RV** or transient terminology—permanent manufactured/mobile home communities only.
- **Public contact policy**: Display **[ContactPhone]** and **[ContactEmail]** only.
- **Pet policy**: “**We follow PetScreening.com’s policies and approval process.**” (Use this exact language via **[PetPolicy]**.)
- **Resident portal**: Use **[PortalURL]** as provided (DoorLoop).
- **Verification**: **Do not** publish unverified park facts. See §9 Source-of-Truth.

---

## 2) Brand, Tone & Visual System

**Palette**: Red / White / Blue with **Gold** accent.

- Blues for structure and depth; red as primary CTA; gold as subtle accent (rules, icon strokes, dividers).  
  **Typography**: Refined, modern sans; ample white space; disciplined hierarchy.  
  **Iconography**: Monotone **SVG line icons** (1.5px stroke). Absolutely no emojis.  
  **Voice**: Local, confident, concise, benefit-led; high style and taste.

---

## 3) Information Architecture (One-Page with Anchors)

**Top Navigation**: Home, Community, Amenities, **Comparison**, Gallery, Map, Contact, **Resident Login** (→ **[PortalURL]**), **Apply Now** (→ **[ApplyLink]**). Sticky on scroll.

### A) Hero — Pain-Based Hook (**Required**)

- **H1**: “[CommunityName]”
- **H2 (pain hook)**: Auto-generated using **local 3 bed / 2 bath apartment** market rent (derived at build time from reputable sources; used as **market context only**, not park facts).  
  **Pattern (example):**  
  “**Tired of paying $X for a 3-bed, 2-bath apartment in [CityStateZIP]?**”
  - Extract city/state from **[CityStateZIP]**.
  - **X** = current local 3BR/2BA monthly average (trimmed mean across sources).
  - Add a subtle info icon that jumps to **Comparison** (sources + date).
- **Subline**: “See how owning your own home at **[CommunityName]** can cost less—local, single-level living with privacy and a yard.”
- **CTAs**: **Apply Now** → **[ApplyLink]**; **Compare Costs** → `#comparison`.
- **Visual**: Full-bleed community image/video, luxury overlay; no emojis.

### B) Community Overview

Elegant paragraph using **only**: **[CommunityName]**, **[CityStateZIP]**, **[AgeRestriction]**, **[NumSites]**, **[Tagline]**, **[LotRent]**, **[PetPolicy]**, **[ContactPhone]**, **[ContactEmail]**, **[ManagerName]**, **[Amenities]**, **[LocationHighlights]**.  
**Snapshot list** (icons): address (**[StreetAddress]**, **[CityStateZIP]**), lot rent (**[LotRent]**/mo), pet policy (**[PetPolicy]** with link to PetScreening.com), manager (if public), contact (**[ContactPhone]** · **[ContactEmail]**), **Resident Login** (**[PortalURL]**), **Apply Now** (**[ApplyLink]**).

### C) Highlights & Amenities

3–6 feature cards using **[Amenities]** and **[LocationHighlights]**. Icons only. If an item isn’t in variables/client docs, **omit**.

### D) **Value & Cost Comparison** (`#comparison`) — **3 Bed / 2 Bath Only**

- **Apartment comps**: Display the **local 3BR/2BA monthly average** (no 1BR; no 2BR).
  - Compute from 2+ reputable sources within last 30 days; show **sources** and **collection date**.
  - Present as **market context** only (not park facts).
- **Illustrative “Own For Less” monthly**: Transparent, conservative breakdown:
  - Mortgage P&I (typical local home price & reasonable APR/term),
  - **Lot Rent: [LotRent]**,
  - Estimated taxes,
  - Estimated insurance,
  - (HOA/other if applicable).
  - Show assumptions & date in a footnote.
- **Non-price advantages** (icon bullets): **No stairs**, **No wall-to-wall neighbors**, **You own it** (equity & control), **Yard & parking at your door**, **Local convenience** (reflect **[LocationHighlights]**).

### E) Lifestyle / Gallery

3–6 curated images with accurate, descriptive alt text; lazy-loaded; tasteful captions. Use only client-approved images or neutral lifestyle images that do **not** imply they depict the exact park.

### F) Map & Directions

Embedded map centered on **[StreetAddress]**, **[CityStateZIP]** with “Get Directions” deep link.

### G) Contact & Apply

Buttons: **Call** → tel:**[ContactPhone]**, **Email** → mailto:**[ContactEmail]**, **Apply Now** → **[ApplyLink]**, **Resident Login** → **[PortalURL]**.  
Accessible contact form (name, email, phone, message) → **[ContactEmail]** (or approved handler) + privacy note.

### H) Footer

© **[CommunityName]**. Equal Housing Opportunity. Minimal policy links (Privacy, Sitemap).

---

## 4) SEO & Metadata (Long-Tail, High-Intent — Local)

- **Keyword strategy**: Generate and weave **long-tail, high-intent local** phrases across headings/body/alt/meta, e.g.:
  - “mobile home park in _city_ _state_”
  - “manufactured homes _city_”
  - “lot rent _city_”
  - “pet-friendly manufactured home community _city_”
  - “55+ manufactured home community _city_” (only if **[AgeRestriction]** indicates age-restricted)
- **Title (Home)**: “[CommunityName] — Manufactured Home Community in [CityStateZIP] | Lot Rent [LotRent]”
- **Meta description**: 150–160 chars; include community type, city/state, key benefit, and CTA.
- **Headings**: One H1; H2s align to sections/keywords naturally.
- **Structured data**: JSON-LD `LocalBusiness` / `ManufacturedHomeCommunity` with name, URL (**[Domain]**), phone (**[ContactPhone]**), address (**[StreetAddress]**, **[CityStateZIP]**).
- **Sitemap & robots**: Generate `public/sitemap.xml`, `public/robots.txt`.
- **Performance**: Fast, responsive, lazy-load images, minify CSS/JS.

---

## 5) Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- Palette contrast (including gold accent) meets AA.
- Semantic landmarks (header/nav/main/footer); logical heading order.
- Keyboard navigable; visible focus states; skip-to-content link.
- Labeled forms, ARIA as needed; descriptive alt text.
- Comparison table/cards: headers, scopes, captions for screen readers.

---

## 6) Pet Policy (Exact Language)

- **[PetPolicy]** must read exactly: **“We follow PetScreening.com’s policies and approval process.”**
- Link to PetScreening.com in FAQ/Community Info. Do **not** add other pet details unless in variables/client docs.

---

## 7) Resident Portal

- Use **[PortalURL]** exactly as provided (DoorLoop expected).
- Header and footer links labeled **Resident Login** point to **[PortalURL]**.

---

## 8) Technical Delivery (Static HTML/CSS/JS)

**Outputs (repo tree)**

**Build notes**

- Vanilla static stack (no frameworks).

- `main.js` handles smooth scroll, minimal form validation.
- Lighthouse targets (mobile & desktop): **Perf ≥ 90**, **A11y ≥ 95**, **SEO ≥ 95**, **Best Practices ≥ 95**.

---

## 9) Source of Truth & Verification (Core Rules)

**Allowed without extra proof**

- **Variables** in this PRD (exact values).
- Client-provided docs (e.g., Notion pages explicitly provided by the client).

**External info policy**

- **Park facts** (amenities, policies beyond **[PetPolicy]**, manager names, lot counts, rent amounts, distances, “recent improvements,” crime/school claims, etc.) **must not** be taken from external sources unless the client provided them. If a detail isn’t in variables/client docs, **omit it** and add a TODO entry in `qa/report.md`.
- **Market context only**: External data may be used **only** for the **3BR/2BA apartment comparison** (Hero & Comparison) and must include sources + collection date. These figures are **not** park facts.

**Photography**

- Use only client-approved images or clearly generic lifestyle images that do **not** imply they show the park. If a caption implies a park-specific feature not in variables/client docs, remove it.

**Verification Log (required)**

- Produce `/qa/verification_log.md` mapping every factual onsite statement to **VARIABLE**, **CLIENT DOC**, or **MARKET CONTEXT** (comparison only, with URL + date). Any unmatched statement must be removed before launch.

**Redline Lint (build-time)**

- QA scans for banned/unverified claim patterns (e.g., “low crime,” “top schools,” “minutes from…,” “$X in improvements,” unlisted amenities). If found, **fail the build** with details in `/qa/report.md`.

---

## 10) Research & Computation (3 Bed / 2 Bath ONLY)

- **Apartment comps**: Gather **local 3BR/2BA** monthly average from 2+ reputable sources (e.g., Apartments.com, Zillow, Rent.com, Zumper) within the last 30 days. Compute a trimmed mean. Save to `/data/comps.json` with `sources[]` and `collected_at`.
- **Hero pain-hook**: Use the computed 3BR/2BA average “$X” in the H2 (see §3A). Format as whole dollars with thousands separators.
- **Ownership illustration**: Compute a transparent, conservative monthly estimate (mortgage P&I + **[LotRent]** + taxes + insurance [+ HOA if applicable]). Show assumptions & date.

---

## 11) LLM Manifest — `public/llm.txt` (Required)

Plain-text description for LLMs (no marketing fluff):

- Site identity: **[CommunityName]**, **[Domain]**, **[StreetAddress]**, **[CityStateZIP]**.
- Audience: Prospects for permanent manufactured/mobile home living; current residents (portal).
- Purpose: Inform (lot rent **[LotRent]**, **[Amenities]**, **[LocationHighlights]**) → Convert (Apply/Contact) → Support (Resident Login **[PortalURL]**).
- Pet policy: **[PetPolicy]** (PetScreening.com).
- Boundaries: No RV/transient stays. Public contact only (**[ContactPhone]**, **[ContactEmail]**).
- Style: Luxury, high-taste, local; icons only; no emojis.
- SEO: Include 8–12 long-tail local queries.
- **Pain hook**: Reference the computed **3BR/2BA** apartment average from `/data/comps.json` and direct users to the on-site **Comparison** section for methods, sources, and date.

---

## 12) QA & Acceptance Criteria

A build **cannot** ship if any of the following are true:

- Variables are altered (added/renamed/removed) or not used consistently.
- Any park/community statement lacks a match in variables/client docs in `/qa/verification_log.md`.
- External data is presented as park facts (rather than **market context** in Comparison).
- Hero lacks the **local pain-based hook** using **3BR/2BA** comps with sources/date in Comparison.
- **[PetPolicy]** deviates from “We follow PetScreening.com’s policies and approval process.”
- **Resident Login** is not **[PortalURL]** in header & footer; **Apply** not **[ApplyLink]**.
- Any emoji use; icons not SVG line style.
- Accessibility or Lighthouse targets not met.
- `public/llm.txt` missing or incomplete.

**Pass conditions**

- All park facts trace to variables/client docs; verification log complete.
- Hero pain-hook (3BR/2BA) present; Comparison shows sources/date and ownership math with assumptions.
- PetScreening and DoorLoop integrated per variables.
- Luxury/local tone; no emojis; SVG icons only.
- SEO long-tail implemented; metadata, JSON-LD, sitemap/robots complete.
- WCAG 2.1 AA and Lighthouse targets achieved.

---

## 13) Maintenance

- Keep **[LotRent]** current; periodically refresh `/data/comps.json` (e.g., quarterly) and update hero/Comparison accordingly.
- Update imagery with client-approved assets only.
- Re-run QA redline and verification log on each content change.
